All types of animal are motile which means they can move independently and spontaneously from the point of their lives. All animals are heterotrophs. Most known animal phyla marine species. Animals are sub dived into various sub-groups like vertebrates, mollusks, arthropods, annelids, sponges and fishes. These subgroups are sub-classified into their respective groups.
          As animals are heterotrophs, it means they feed on living organism directly or indirectly. Again these are subdivided into herbivores, carnivores, omnivores and parasites. Generally, all animals are predators. It means they hunt for food on other living organisms. In general extinction of some animals had taken place since some year due to variations in the earth.</p>

        <p id="Cdata">Animals are generally considered to have evolved from a flagellated eukaryote. These are living close to hydrothermal vents and cold seeps on the ocean floor will not depend on the energy of sunlight. Animals are divided into two broad groups: vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates are animals which have a backbone.  Invertebrates are animals which do not have a backbone. There are different types of animals in the world. Here today we briefly explain about the list of  25 different types of animals in the world with their photos.</p>
